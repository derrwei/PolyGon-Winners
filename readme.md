Our project is a website which allows users to anonymously comment their companies. In return, users can get ERC20.

The comments will be uploaded to the blockchain as NFTs, minted by our Smart Contract.

## Motivations
![Other Companies](Pictures/other_co.png)
Traditionally, other workplace commenting websites operate on their private servers. 

**However**, 
* Unsafe for commenters, since uploads traceable
* Companies can pay to delete comments
* Vulnerable to attacks


## Why use NFT and blockchain?
- Our model is based on anonymous posts
- NFT can take different forms, flexibility allow comments to be minted as NFT
- Once the NFT comments are uploaded to blockchain, they cannot be deleted 
- The NFT comments can be re-minted for wider distributions
